Welcome to the Telegram-bot! (@m6kvmdlcmdr) by Rev. Duncan Ross Palmer

## What is Telegram?

[Telegram](https://telegram.org) is a secure messenger used by a diverse audience and used on multiple platforms.
It offers a rich API layer and bots can easily be authorized by having a conversation with a bot called [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
If you would like to run your own copy of this telegram-bot, you will need to do this!  Start with this [tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial).

## Documentation

For up to date documentation, please ensure you are viewing the latest copy at [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/telegram-bot/tree/f/docs/item/README.md)

## Project goals

The project started out as a way to quickly ask a remote copy of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to perform downloads of music videos, but this has thus far been an semi-abandoned goal.  Instead, the bot quickly took on a rapid growth of off-the-cuff ideas. See features.  We would appreciate any patches or forks!

## Setup / installation

TODO: nb. most users will not be installing this bot, and therefore instructions will be perfected later.
For the moment, we will direct you to features instead.

The bot relies on too many external, unpackaged dependencies at the moment to set up by third parties.

## Talking to the Bot

Find the bot online under the name [m6kvmdlcmdr](https://t.me/m6kvmdlcmdrbot) (@m6kvmdlcmdrbot).
The exact username is due to a requirement by Telegram for all bots' usernames to end with the word 'bot'.

If you run the bot yourself, substitute your preferred username - but remember that aforementioned requirement.
