Hosea<>4<>1<>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because [there is] no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
Hosea<>4<>2<>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
Hosea<>4<>3<>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
Hosea<>4<>4<>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people [are] as they that strive with the priest.
Hosea<>4<>5<>Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
Hosea<>4<>6<>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
Hosea<>4<>7<>As they were increased, so they sinned against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame.
Hosea<>4<>8<>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
Hosea<>4<>9<>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
Hosea<>4<>10<>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
Hosea<>4<>11<>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
Hosea<>4<>12<>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
Hosea<>4<>13<>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is] good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
Hosea<>4<>14<>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people [that] doth not understand shall fall.
Hosea<>4<>15<>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, [yet] let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.
Hosea<>4<>16<>For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
Hosea<>4<>17<>Ephraim [is] joined to idols: let him alone.
Hosea<>4<>18<>Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers [with] shame do love, Give ye.
Hosea<>4<>19<>The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
