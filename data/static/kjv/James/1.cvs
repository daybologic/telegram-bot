James<>1<>1<>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
James<>1<>2<>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
James<>1<>3<>Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
James<>1<>4<>But let patience have [her] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
James<>1<>5<>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
James<>1<>6<>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
James<>1<>7<>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
James<>1<>8<>A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.
James<>1<>9<>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
James<>1<>10<>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
James<>1<>11<>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
James<>1<>12<>Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
James<>1<>13<>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
James<>1<>14<>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
James<>1<>15<>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
James<>1<>16<>Do not err, my beloved brethren.
James<>1<>17<>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
James<>1<>18<>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
James<>1<>19<>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
James<>1<>20<>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
James<>1<>21<>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
James<>1<>22<>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
James<>1<>23<>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
James<>1<>24<>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
James<>1<>25<>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth [therein], he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
James<>1<>26<>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain.
James<>1<>27<>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world.
