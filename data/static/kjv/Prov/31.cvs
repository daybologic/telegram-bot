Prov<>31<>1<>The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
Prov<>31<>2<>What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
Prov<>31<>3<>Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
Prov<>31<>4<>[It is] not for kings, O Lemuel, [it is] not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
Prov<>31<>5<>Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
Prov<>31<>6<>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
Prov<>31<>7<>Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
Prov<>31<>8<>Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
Prov<>31<>9<>Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
Prov<>31<>10<>Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price [is] far above rubies.
Prov<>31<>11<>The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
Prov<>31<>12<>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
Prov<>31<>13<>She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
Prov<>31<>14<>She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
Prov<>31<>15<>She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
Prov<>31<>16<>She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
Prov<>31<>17<>She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
Prov<>31<>18<>She perceiveth that her merchandise [is] good: her candle goeth not out by night.
Prov<>31<>19<>She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
Prov<>31<>20<>She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
Prov<>31<>21<>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household [are] clothed with scarlet.
Prov<>31<>22<>She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing [is] silk and purple.
Prov<>31<>23<>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
Prov<>31<>24<>She maketh fine linen, and selleth [it]; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
Prov<>31<>25<>Strength and honour [are] her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
Prov<>31<>26<>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue [is] the law of kindness.
Prov<>31<>27<>She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
Prov<>31<>28<>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband [also], and he praiseth her.
Prov<>31<>29<>Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
Prov<>31<>30<>Favour [is] deceitful, and beauty [is] vain: [but] a woman [that] feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
Prov<>31<>31<>Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
