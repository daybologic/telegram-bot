Psa<>11<>1<>To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David. In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee [as] a bird to your mountain?
Psa<>11<>2<>For, lo, the wicked bend [their] bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
Psa<>11<>3<>If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
Psa<>11<>4<>The LORD [is] in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne [is] in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
Psa<>11<>5<>The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
Psa<>11<>6<>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: [this shall be] the portion of their cup.
Psa<>11<>7<>For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
