Psa<>115<>1<>Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, [and] for thy truth's sake.
Psa<>115<>2<>Wherefore should the heathen say, Where [is] now their God?
Psa<>115<>3<>But our God [is] in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
Psa<>115<>4<>Their idols [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
Psa<>115<>5<>They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
Psa<>115<>6<>They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
Psa<>115<>7<>They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
Psa<>115<>8<>They that make them are like unto them; [so is] every one that trusteth in them.
Psa<>115<>9<>O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield.
Psa<>115<>10<>O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield.
Psa<>115<>11<>Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield.
Psa<>115<>12<>The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless [us]; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
Psa<>115<>13<>He will bless them that fear the LORD, [both] small and great.
Psa<>115<>14<>The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Psa<>115<>15<>Ye [are] blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
Psa<>115<>16<>The heaven, [even] the heavens, [are] the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
Psa<>115<>17<>The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
Psa<>115<>18<>But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
