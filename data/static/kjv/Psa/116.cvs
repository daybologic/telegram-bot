Psa<>116<>1<>I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice [and] my supplications.
Psa<>116<>2<>Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon [him] as long as I live.
Psa<>116<>3<>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
Psa<>116<>4<>Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
Psa<>116<>5<>Gracious [is] the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God [is] merciful.
Psa<>116<>6<>The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
Psa<>116<>7<>Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
Psa<>116<>8<>For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, [and] my feet from falling.
Psa<>116<>9<>I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
Psa<>116<>10<>I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
Psa<>116<>11<>I said in my haste, All men [are] liars.
Psa<>116<>12<>What shall I render unto the LORD [for] all his benefits toward me?
Psa<>116<>13<>I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa<>116<>14<>I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
Psa<>116<>15<>Precious in the sight of the LORD [is] the death of his saints.
Psa<>116<>16<>O LORD, truly I [am] thy servant; I [am] thy servant, [and] the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
Psa<>116<>17<>I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.
Psa<>116<>18<>I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,
Psa<>116<>19<>In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
