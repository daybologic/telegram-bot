Psa<>120<>1<>A Song of degrees. In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
Psa<>120<>2<>Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, [and] from a deceitful tongue.
Psa<>120<>3<>What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
Psa<>120<>4<>Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
Psa<>120<>5<>Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, [that] I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
Psa<>120<>6<>My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
Psa<>120<>7<>I [am for] peace: but when I speak, they [are] for war.
