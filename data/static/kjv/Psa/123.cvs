Psa<>123<>1<>A Song of degrees. Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Psa<>123<>2<>Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] unto the hand of their masters, [and] as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes [wait] upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
Psa<>123<>3<>Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Psa<>123<>4<>Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, [and] with the contempt of the proud.
