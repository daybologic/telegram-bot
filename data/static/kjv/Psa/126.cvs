Psa<>126<>1<>A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
Psa<>126<>2<>Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
Psa<>126<>3<>The LORD hath done great things for us; [whereof] we are glad.
Psa<>126<>4<>Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
Psa<>126<>5<>They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
Psa<>126<>6<>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves [with him].
