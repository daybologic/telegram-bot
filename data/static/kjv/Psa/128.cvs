Psa<>128<>1<>A Song of degrees. Blessed [is] every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
Psa<>128<>2<>For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy [shalt] thou [be], and [it shall be] well with thee.
Psa<>128<>3<>Thy wife [shall be] as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Psa<>128<>4<>Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
Psa<>128<>5<>The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
Psa<>128<>6<>Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, [and] peace upon Israel.
