Psa<>129<>1<>A Song of degrees. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
Psa<>129<>2<>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
Psa<>129<>3<>The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
Psa<>129<>4<>The LORD [is] righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
Psa<>129<>5<>Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
Psa<>129<>6<>Let them be as the grass [upon] the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
Psa<>129<>7<>Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
Psa<>129<>8<>Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD [be] upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
