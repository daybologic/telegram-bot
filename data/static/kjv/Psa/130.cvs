Psa<>130<>1<>A Song of degrees. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
Psa<>130<>2<>Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Psa<>130<>3<>If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
Psa<>130<>4<>But [there is] forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
Psa<>130<>5<>I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
Psa<>130<>6<>My soul [waiteth] for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: [I say, more than] they that watch for the morning.
Psa<>130<>7<>Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD [there is] mercy, and with him [is] plenteous redemption.
Psa<>130<>8<>And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
