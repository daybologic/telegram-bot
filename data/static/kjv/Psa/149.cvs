Psa<>149<>6<>[Let] the high [praises] of God [be] in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;
Psa<>149<>7<>To execute vengeance upon the heathen, [and] punishments upon the people;
Psa<>149<>8<>To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
Psa<>149<>9<>To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
