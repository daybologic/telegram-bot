Psa<>20<>1<>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Psa<>20<>2<>Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Psa<>20<>3<>Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Psa<>20<>4<>Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
Psa<>20<>5<>We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up [our] banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
Psa<>20<>6<>Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Psa<>20<>7<>Some [trust] in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
Psa<>20<>8<>They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Psa<>20<>9<>Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
