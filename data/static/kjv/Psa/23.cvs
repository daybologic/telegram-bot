Psa<>23<>1<>A Psalm of David. The LORD [is] my shepherd; I shall not want.
Psa<>23<>2<>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
Psa<>23<>3<>He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Psa<>23<>4<>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Psa<>23<>5<>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Psa<>23<>6<>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
