Psa<>34<>1<>[A Psalm] of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise [shall] continually [be] in my mouth.
Psa<>34<>2<>My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear [thereof], and be glad.
Psa<>34<>3<>O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
Psa<>34<>4<>I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
Psa<>34<>5<>They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
Psa<>34<>6<>This poor man cried, and the LORD heard [him], and saved him out of all his troubles.
Psa<>34<>7<>The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
Psa<>34<>8<>O taste and see that the LORD [is] good: blessed [is] the man [that] trusteth in him.
Psa<>34<>9<>O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for [there is] no want to them that fear him.
Psa<>34<>10<>The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good [thing].
Psa<>34<>11<>Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
Psa<>34<>12<>What man [is he that] desireth life, [and] loveth [many] days, that he may see good?
Psa<>34<>13<>Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
Psa<>34<>14<>Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
Psa<>34<>15<>The eyes of the LORD [are] upon the righteous, and his ears [are open] unto their cry.
Psa<>34<>16<>The face of the LORD [is] against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
Psa<>34<>17<>[The righteous] cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
Psa<>34<>18<>The LORD [is] nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
Psa<>34<>19<>Many [are] the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
Psa<>34<>20<>He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
Psa<>34<>21<>Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
Psa<>34<>22<>The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
