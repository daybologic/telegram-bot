Psa<>44<>1<>To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, [what] work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
Psa<>44<>2<>[How] thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; [how] thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
Psa<>44<>3<>For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
Psa<>44<>4<>Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
Psa<>44<>5<>Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
Psa<>44<>6<>For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
Psa<>44<>7<>But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
Psa<>44<>8<>In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
Psa<>44<>9<>But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
Psa<>44<>10<>Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
Psa<>44<>11<>Thou hast given us like sheep [appointed] for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
Psa<>44<>12<>Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase [thy wealth] by their price.
Psa<>44<>13<>Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
Psa<>44<>14<>Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
Psa<>44<>15<>My confusion [is] continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
Psa<>44<>16<>For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
Psa<>44<>17<>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
Psa<>44<>18<>Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
Psa<>44<>19<>Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
Psa<>44<>20<>If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
Psa<>44<>21<>Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
Psa<>44<>22<>Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Psa<>44<>23<>Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast [us] not off for ever.
Psa<>44<>24<>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, [and] forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
Psa<>44<>25<>For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
Psa<>44<>26<>Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
