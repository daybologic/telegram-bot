Psa<>49<>1<>To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. Hear this, all [ye] people; give ear, all [ye] inhabitants of the world:
Psa<>49<>2<>Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
Psa<>49<>3<>My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart [shall be] of understanding.
Psa<>49<>4<>I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
Psa<>49<>5<>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, [when] the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
Psa<>49<>6<>They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
Psa<>49<>7<>None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
Psa<>49<>8<>(For the redemption of their soul [is] precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
Psa<>49<>9<>That he should still live for ever, [and] not see corruption.
Psa<>49<>10<>For he seeth [that] wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
Psa<>49<>11<>Their inward thought [is, that] their houses [shall continue] for ever, [and] their dwelling places to all generations; they call [their] lands after their own names.
Psa<>49<>12<>Nevertheless man [being] in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts [that] perish.
Psa<>49<>13<>This their way [is] their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
Psa<>49<>14<>Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
Psa<>49<>15<>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
Psa<>49<>16<>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
Psa<>49<>17<>For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
Psa<>49<>18<>Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and [men] will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
Psa<>49<>19<>He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
Psa<>49<>20<>Man [that is] in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts [that] perish.
