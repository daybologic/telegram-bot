Psa<>5<>1<>To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
Psa<>5<>2<>Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
Psa<>5<>3<>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct [my prayer] unto thee, and will look up.
Psa<>5<>4<>For thou [art] not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
Psa<>5<>5<>The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Psa<>5<>6<>Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
Psa<>5<>7<>But as for me, I will come [into] thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: [and] in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Psa<>5<>8<>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
Psa<>5<>9<>For [there is] no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part [is] very wickedness; their throat [is] an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Psa<>5<>10<>Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
Psa<>5<>11<>But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
Psa<>5<>12<>For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as [with] a shield.
