Psa<>54<>1<>To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David, when the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
Psa<>54<>2<>Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
Psa<>54<>3<>For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
Psa<>54<>4<>Behold, God [is] mine helper: the Lord [is] with them that uphold my soul.
Psa<>54<>5<>He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
Psa<>54<>6<>I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for [it is] good.
Psa<>54<>7<>For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen [his desire] upon mine enemies.
