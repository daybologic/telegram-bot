Psa<>62<>1<>To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David. Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him [cometh] my salvation.
Psa<>62<>2<>He only [is] my rock and my salvation; [he is] my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
Psa<>62<>3<>How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall [shall ye be, and as] a tottering fence.
Psa<>62<>4<>They only consult to cast [him] down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
Psa<>62<>5<>My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation [is] from him.
Psa<>62<>6<>He only [is] my rock and my salvation: [he is] my defence; I shall not be moved.
Psa<>62<>7<>In God [is] my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, [and] my refuge, [is] in God.
Psa<>62<>8<>Trust in him at all times; [ye] people, pour out your heart before him: God [is] a refuge for us. Selah.
Psa<>62<>9<>Surely men of low degree [are] vanity, [and] men of high degree [are] a lie: to be laid in the balance, they [are] altogether [lighter] than vanity.
Psa<>62<>10<>Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart [upon them].
Psa<>62<>11<>God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power [belongeth] unto God.
Psa<>62<>12<>Also unto thee, O Lord, [belongeth] mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
