Psa<>66<>1<>To the chief Musician, A Song [or] Psalm. Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
Psa<>66<>2<>Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
Psa<>66<>3<>Say unto God, How terrible [art thou in] thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
Psa<>66<>4<>All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing [to] thy name. Selah.
Psa<>66<>5<>Come and see the works of God: [he is] terrible [in his] doing toward the children of men.
Psa<>66<>6<>He turned the sea into dry [land]: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
Psa<>66<>7<>He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
Psa<>66<>8<>O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
Psa<>66<>9<>Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
Psa<>66<>10<>For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
Psa<>66<>11<>Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
Psa<>66<>12<>Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy [place].
Psa<>66<>13<>I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
Psa<>66<>14<>Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
Psa<>66<>15<>I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
Psa<>66<>16<>Come [and] hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
Psa<>66<>17<>I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
Psa<>66<>18<>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear [me]:
Psa<>66<>19<>[But] verily God hath heard [me]; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
Psa<>66<>20<>Blessed [be] God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
