Psa<>80<>1<>To the chief Musician upon Shoshannimeduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest [between] the cherubims, shine forth.
Psa<>80<>2<>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come [and] save us.
Psa<>80<>3<>Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa<>80<>4<>O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Psa<>80<>5<>Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
Psa<>80<>6<>Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psa<>80<>7<>Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Psa<>80<>8<>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Psa<>80<>9<>Thou preparedst [room] before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
Psa<>80<>10<>The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof [were like] the goodly cedars.
Psa<>80<>11<>She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
Psa<>80<>12<>Why hast thou [then] broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
Psa<>80<>13<>The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Psa<>80<>14<>Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
Psa<>80<>15<>And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch [that] thou madest strong for thyself.
Psa<>80<>16<>[It is] burned with fire, [it is] cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Psa<>80<>17<>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man [whom] thou madest strong for thyself.
Psa<>80<>18<>So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Psa<>80<>19<>Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
