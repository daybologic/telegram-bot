Psa<>82<>1<>A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
Psa<>82<>2<>How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Psa<>82<>3<>Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Psa<>82<>4<>Deliver the poor and needy: rid [them] out of the hand of the wicked.
Psa<>82<>5<>They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
Psa<>82<>6<>I have said, Ye [are] gods; and all of you [are] children of the most High.
Psa<>82<>7<>But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Psa<>82<>8<>Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
