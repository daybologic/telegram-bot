Psa<>9<>1<>To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise [thee], O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
Psa<>9<>2<>I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
Psa<>9<>3<>When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
Psa<>9<>4<>For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
Psa<>9<>5<>Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
Psa<>9<>6<>O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
Psa<>9<>7<>But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
Psa<>9<>8<>And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
Psa<>9<>9<>The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
Psa<>9<>10<>And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
Psa<>9<>11<>Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
Psa<>9<>12<>When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
Psa<>9<>13<>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble [which I suffer] of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
Psa<>9<>14<>That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
Psa<>9<>15<>The heathen are sunk down in the pit [that] they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
Psa<>9<>16<>The LORD is known [by] the judgment [which] he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
Psa<>9<>17<>The wicked shall be turned into hell, [and] all the nations that forget God.
Psa<>9<>18<>For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall [not] perish for ever.
Psa<>9<>19<>Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
Psa<>9<>20<>Put them in fear, O LORD: [that] the nations may know themselves [to be but] men. Selah.
