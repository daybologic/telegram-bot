Psa<>91<>1<>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
Psa<>91<>2<>I will say of the LORD, [He is] my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
Psa<>91<>3<>Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, [and] from the noisome pestilence.
Psa<>91<>4<>He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth [shall be thy] shield and buckler.
Psa<>91<>5<>Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; [nor] for the arrow [that] flieth by day;
Psa<>91<>6<>[Nor] for the pestilence [that] walketh in darkness; [nor] for the destruction [that] wasteth at noonday.
Psa<>91<>7<>A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; [but] it shall not come nigh thee.
Psa<>91<>8<>Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Psa<>91<>9<>Because thou hast made the LORD, [which is] my refuge, [even] the most High, thy habitation;
Psa<>91<>10<>There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
Psa<>91<>11<>For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
Psa<>91<>12<>They shall bear thee up in [their] hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Psa<>91<>13<>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
Psa<>91<>14<>Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
Psa<>91<>15<>He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I [will be] with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
Psa<>91<>16<>With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
