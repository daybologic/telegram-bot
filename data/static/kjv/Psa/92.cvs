Psa<>92<>1<>A Psalm [or] Song for the sabbath day. [It is a] good [thing] to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
Psa<>92<>2<>To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
Psa<>92<>3<>Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
Psa<>92<>4<>For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
Psa<>92<>5<>O LORD, how great are thy works! [and] thy thoughts are very deep.
Psa<>92<>6<>A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
Psa<>92<>7<>When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; [it is] that they shall be destroyed for ever:
Psa<>92<>8<>But thou, LORD, [art most] high for evermore.
Psa<>92<>9<>For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
Psa<>92<>10<>But my horn shalt thou exalt like [the horn of] an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
Psa<>92<>11<>Mine eye also shall see [my desire] on mine enemies, [and] mine ears shall hear [my desire] of the wicked that rise up against me.
Psa<>92<>12<>The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Psa<>92<>13<>Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
Psa<>92<>14<>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
Psa<>92<>15<>To shew that the LORD [is] upright: [he is] my rock, and [there is] no unrighteousness in him.
